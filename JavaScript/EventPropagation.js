// Event Propagation in JavaScript
// Event propagation describes the order in which events are handled when an event occurs on an element that is nested inside other elements.

// There are 3 phases:

// ğŸ”¸ 1. Capturing Phase (a.k.a. Capture or Trickle Down)
// The event starts from the window and travels down to the target element.

// Listeners added with addEventListener('click', handler, true) are triggered here.

// ğŸ”¸ 2. Target Phase
// The event reaches the actual element where the event happened.

// ğŸ”¸ 3. Bubbling Phase (a.k.a. Bubble Up)
// The event bubbles up from the target to the top (like document).

// Listeners added with addEventListener('click', handler) (default false) run here.

1. how you know about byldd?

I came to know about Byldd around 6 months ago when my friend Vijendra got placed there. He shared his positive experience about the company, its culture, and the kind of real-world projects they work on. His experience really caught my interest, so I explored more about the company on my own.

After doing some research, I was genuinely impressed with how Byldd helps startups build and launch their products efficiently, focusing only on what’s truly needed. That’s when I realized it’s the kind of environment I’d love to be part of.

I want to join Byldd because my skills match the kind of work you do. I already have 4 months of experience as a full stack developer at Sports For All, where I worked on both frontend and backend. I really enjoy building real products that solve problems.

I also like how Byldd helps startups launch their products quickly without wasting time or money. It’s a fast-paced and practical environment where I know I’ll learn a lot and grow as a developer. That’s why I’m excited to be a part of the team.

In five years, I see myself growing both technically and professionally. I want to become a highly skilled developer who can take on challenging projects, contribute innovative ideas, and mentor junior developers.

At the same time, I’d love to take on more responsibility, possibly leading a team or working closely with clients to deliver impactful solutions.

I’m excited about the opportunity to grow with Byldd and help the company achieve its mission of building successful startups while developing my own skills along the way.

5.How do you handle feedback?
Answer:
"I see feedback as an opportunity to grow and improve. In my previous role, I received constructive feedback on improving my code optimization. I took it seriously, researched best practices, and applied what I learned to future projects, resulting in more efficient code.

I value open communication and appreciate when others take the time to help me improve."

6.what is your strength?
My greatest strength is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges. For example, in a recent project, I had to pick up a new technology within a tight deadline to meet the project requirements, and I successfully implemented it without compromising quality.

I’m also a strong team player and communicate well, which helps in collaborative environments like the one at Byldd

7.what is your weakness?
One area I’m working to improve is trying to do everything on my own. Since I’m still early in my career, I sometimes take too much responsibility to prove myself or make sure everything is right. But I’ve realized that teamwork and trusting others is also very important. So now, I’m learning to communicate better, ask for help when needed, and work more closely with my team. This is helping me learn faster and become a better team player.

One area I'm working to improve is speaking up during meetings or discussions. Sometimes, I hesitate to share my ideas because I feel others might have more experience than me. But I’ve realized that every idea can add value, and asking questions is also part of learning. So I’m now trying to be more confident, share my thoughts, and participate more actively. It’s helping me build better communication skills and grow faster as a developer.
